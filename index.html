<p>Foreign domestic helpers are charged placement fees when they use an agency. Domestic helpers are even charged up to 75% of their salary for the first 12 months of employment. They are a more vulnerable group as they search for better lives overseas. In the Philippines agencies cannot charge any placement fee legally, but they compensate for it by charging more for training fees, boarding housing, food allowance, medical check-ups and so on. In Indonesia placement fees are set at a fixed amount, but here also agencies have found ways to charge illegally.</p>

<p>Agencies have found many ways to charge illegal fees from domestic workers who cannot find employment elsewhere. Bad employment agencies keeps for example the passport until the Filipino helper has paid many months of wages. In another instance, the Indonesian helper is brought to a money lender – aka loan shark – with whom the agency has a deal so that she can pay the agency outstanding charges. Employers looking for a helper are unaware of these practices and helpers are afraid to tell their employer.</p>

<p>In cases when the maid is vulnerable, the agency is more likely to charge her illegal fees. If the helper does not finish her contract – stay with the employer for the duration of their contract – then the agency has more power to charge. Most new employers do not like to offer a new contract to domestic helpers who have broken their contract. Fair agencies will only charge the legal placement fee (depends per country), but other helper agency are not good. It is difficult for a domestic helper to file a complaint against an agency because governments will ask for documentation to proof the illegal charges. No agency will issue these because they know that what they do is wrong.</p>

<h3><a id="no-placement-fee" class="anchor" href="#no-placement-fee" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>No placement fee.</h3>

<p>Think foreign domestic workers are always forced to pay placement fees? This is not the case. There are a few ways how helpers, nannies, housemaids and housekeepers can avoid having to pay extremely high and often illegal commission fees and placement fees!</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Recommended:</strong> find your employer by yourself through help of a friend. Make sure that you actually meet the employer so that you can see if you like the employer. </li>
  <li><strong>Direct search and hire:</strong> you can use an online website, but be careful because these websites often secretly charge domestic helpers a supposedly one-of charge. A website that has been tried and tested by domestic helpers that truly does not charge is www.HelperChoice.com. In most countries if the helper has finished her contract, if the sponsor agrees to transfer the maid, no agency has to be used. If this is not the case, the employer can approach an agency and insist that no placement fee or commission to be charged as the agency did not help to match them. </li>
</ul>

<a id="why-are-placement-fees-bad" class="anchor" href="#why-are-placement-fees-bad" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why are illegal placement fees bad?</h3>

<p>Illegal placement fees are not good for both the domestic helper and the employer! Imagine, your employee owes over 10,000 US dollars to a loan shark because her agency forced her to. Every month she only earns 500 US dollars and 400 will go to the loan shark. It will take her a year, if not longer, to pay off her debt. During this time she will be depressed, upset and distracted, which will badly impact her household chores and her dedication to her job. </p>

<p>So always ask the agency how much you will have to pay if you are a domestic helper or if you are an employer find a good agency that is ethical and that doesn’t charge the helper. Success guaranteed!</p>
